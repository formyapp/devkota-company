                            Our endeavor is to formulate an ideal tax strategy for our clients which is compliant with the law, legitimately reduces the tax bills and yet is not prone to invite litigation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Our specialist tax partners have a responsibility to ensure that the clients tax bill is optimized and they do not pay any unnecessary taxes. This involves a complete understanding of the ever changing tax laws which offer innumerable tax optimization opportunities in the form of deductions, exemptions and claims for losses and expenses. Coupled with an intimate understanding of the clients business and structure the potential tax strategies are formulated, discussed and finalized to minimize the tax bills and having said so, we also recognize the fact that the tax strategy should not be overly aggressive and should not increase clients tax risks so as to plunge them into protracted litigation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Our tax teams constantly monitor the development of jurisprudence, the statutory pronouncements and the amendments in tax laws which invariably have far reaching consequences on the clients’ tax strategies. Our knowledge plays a pivotal role in tax planning, advisory and compliance services.

                        <p>

                                We have very rich experience spanning over a decade of successfully serving multinational clients in areas of direct taxation in Nepal. With the globalization and integration of economies large corporations are operating in different tax regimes with each one of them vying for their share of the corporations profit pie in taxes. The end result can often be paying taxes in multiple tax jurisdictions on the same income. We assist the foreign clients in entity structuring for transaction structuring, advising on the agreements and contracts from tax perspective, understanding and advising on treaty benefits, regulatory compliances and establishing sound global taxation policies.

                            In Nepal, transfer pricing is a relatively new but fast emerging field. Transfer pricing is a complex subject and impacts every area of business – ranging from related party purchases, sales, financing instruments, loans, investments, marketing, distribution, use of tangible and intangible assets, etc.. Multinationals are perceived to be potentially capable of shifting their profits from high tax jurisdictions to low tax jurisdictions with the objective of reducing global tax liability. On this premise the tax regulators view the international transactions between associated enterprises with a lot of skepticism and are able to raise tax issues which have huge tax ramifications. SDC tax team offer advisory services on transfer pricing documentation which are regulatory compliant. Besides, we also render services in areas of transfer pricing study and statutory reporting and representation before tax officers.
